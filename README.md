The course is divided into 10 sessions of 2 hours each, a total of 20 hours, here you will see a guide on how this course is divided and how we will progress.

### Stage 1. Responsive Design, Mobile First theory. (4 - 6 hours).
Web programming is not only knowing how to programming, a web developer must have at least basic knowledge in terms of User Interface (UI) design. Doesn't it happen to you that you are using an app and it is very simple and friendly to use? That's because there was a UI Designer behind that focused on the design of use being the most optimal for its use.

There are many tools to design an application or web page, in this course we will use a free one which is [Figma](https://www.figma.com). Here we are going to develop our page before we start programming, we will only do the visual part of how we would like it to look. We will use [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/es/create/color-wheel) to generate a color palette for our project.
