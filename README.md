**Note:** This is an intermediate level course, I recommend that if you still don't know how to programming, take my [Programming Course](https://github.com/JorgeSarricolea/Programming-Course), where I teach programming from scratch.

## Description

We will create 4 navigation pages and 2 optional ones in case you need them.

## Getting Started
You can clone this repository locally and start working with it, which is my recommendation, but feel free to create it from scratch on your computer.

## Stages
The course is divided into 10 sessions of 2 hours each, a total of 20 hours, here you will see a guide on how this course is divided and how we will progress.

### Stage 1. Responsive Design (Mobile First)
Web programming is not only knowing how to programming, a web developer must have at least basic knowledge in terms of User Interface (UI) design. Doesn't it happen to you that you are using an app and it is very simple and friendly to use? That's because there was a UI Designer behind that focused on the design of use being the most optimal for its use.

There are many tools to design an application or web page, in this course we will use a free one which is [Figma](https://www.figma.com).
