First of all, I invite you to visit the Course Info [clicking here](https://discord.com/channels/1084144643966517249/1088861350832394434/1100873039073263716), where you can not only get more information about this course but also have Premium access so that I can personally teach you how to program step-by-step.

**Note:** This is an intermediate level course, I recommend that if you still don't know how to programming, take my [Programming Course](https://github.com/JorgeSarricolea/Programming-Course), where I teach programming from scratch.

## Description
In this course, I will teach you how to make a webpage from scratch, responsive and host it on a free server like mine, [click here to check it out!](https://jogesarricolea.com) I will teach you the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery. We will create 4 navigation pages and 2 optional ones in case you need them.

## Getting Started
You can clone this repository locally and start working with it, which is my recommendation, but feel free to create it from scratch on your computer.
